  You have an amount of money a0 > 0 and you deposit it with a constant interest rate of p% > 0 per year on the 1st of January 2016.
  You want to have an amount a >= a0.

  Task:

  The function date_nb_days (or dateNbDays...) with parameters a0, a, p will return, as a string, the date on which you have just reached a.

  Example:

  date_nb_days(100, 101, 0.98) --> "2017-01-01" (366 days)

  date_nb_days(100, 150, 2.00) --> "2035-12-26" (7299 days)

  Notes:

  The return format of the date is "YYYY-MM-DD"
  The deposit is always on the "2016-01-01"
  If p% is the rate for a year the rate for a day is p divided by 36000 since banks consider that there are 360 days in a year.
  You have: a0 > 0, p% > 0, a >= a0
</p>

  function date_nb_days (a0, a, p){
    let moneyDeposit = a0;
    let moneySumReached = a;
    let annualRate = p/100;
    let dayRate = p/36000
    const depositDate = new Date("January 01, 2016");
    let withdrawalDate
    let sumIncrese  = moneySumReached -  moneyDeposit;
    let dailyIncrease = moneyDeposit*dayRate;
    let dayCounter = 0
    let i
    for (i=0; i<1000;i+=i){
      moneyDeposit = moneyDeposit + (moneyDeposit*dayRate)
      dayCounter = dayCounter + 1
      if (moneyDeposit >=moneySumReached){
        console.log('Reached, days number: ', dayCounter)
        break;
      }
    }
//    if (moneySumReached)
//    console.log('dailyIncrease', dailyIncrease)
//    let daysPassed = sumIncrese/dailyIncrease;
//    console.log('daysPassed', daysPassed)
